# Q9: Why should you not use fgets or fputs with binary data?

# Q10: A cursed question

### What does the following `printf` statement print?
```c
printf("%c%c%c%c%c%c", 72, 101, 0x6c, 108, 111, 0x0a);
```
# Q11-14: IO
### Q11: How many different values can fgetc return?

### Q12: Why are the names of fgetc, fputc, getc, putc, putchar, and getchar misleading?

### Q13: For each of the following calls to the fopen() library function, give an open() system call that has equivalent semantics relative to the state of the file.

(Note that fopen returns a pointer to a file stream, which abstracts the file away, while the open system call returns a file descriptor.)

* fopen(FilePath, "r")
* fopen(FilePath, "a")
* fopen(FilePath, "w")
* fopen(FilePath, "r+")
* fopen(FilePath, "w+")

### Q14: What is `lseek(3)`? When is it useful, and what does it return?
